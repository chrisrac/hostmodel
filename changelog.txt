host_models.py / host.py
- Added .fit() argument "use_bounds" as bool to determine if user wants to keep negative frequency as option (default, faster), 
or limit fitting to only positive numbers (for frequency/period, slower). Note that negative frequency affects only function 
movement direction, and the number itself is possible and interpretable same way as positive value. 
Analysis based on 300 random datasets indicates keeping negative frequency as option results in better fit models, 
but when visualizing period, an absolute value should be used. Final choice should include testing both options and 
making informed decision adjusted to used data.
use .fit(use_bounds=True) to lock only positive values while fitting (slower), and .fit(use_bounds=False) or .fit() 
[as False is default] to allow all values (faster).
- documentation: updated docstings for missing parameters descriptions
- error control: raise TypeError if multiplier is not a positive integer with according message

host_models.py
- Bounding limit added for curve finder to lock negative frequency/period values due to physical interpretation. 
- Default minimization algorithm for least squares changed to Trust Region Reflective algorithm.
host.py
- handle error message in model fit due to missing "predictions" when model fail to converge in giver repeats from 
undescribed attribute error message to RuntimeError.
