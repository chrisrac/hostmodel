### Project development timeframe:
- [x] pre-alpha code
- [ ] alpha module documentation
- [ ] alpha release (v.0.0.1)
- [x] data preprocessor
- [ ] testing and debugging
- [ ] postprocessor for tables and graphs
- [ ] exceptions and errors handling
- [ ] stability finder
- [ ] testing and debugging
- [ ] beta documentation
- [ ] beta release (v.0.1)
- [ ] magnitude solver (research planned)
- [ ] variate period handling (research planned)
- [ ] testing and debugging
- [ ] full documentation
- [ ] full release v.1

### Known issues:
- [ ] inconsistent naming
- [ ] broken execution link at topological analysis stage
- [ ] returns inconsistencies

### Additional content:
- [ ] function to recreate "y_pred" and function object from parameters returned if "include_pred==False"
- [ ] topological analysis // threshold addition along --

### Known limitations:
- [ ] lack of magnitude solver
- [ ] unable to predict inc/dec magnitudes
- [ ] no variate period handling
